## Architecture

The back end uses LangChain and the OpenAI API for chatbot functionality. All character, session, and bot data are stored in MongoDB.

The front end is built from scratch using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

All queries are handled with REST API.

The current deployment uses Render.com and Netlify for back end and front end hosting, respectively. MongoDB is hosted on an Atlas cluster.
